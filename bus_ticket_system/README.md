## **NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:**

1. **Run the exploration script** to understand your CSV data
2. **Customize the classes** in `models.py` based on your actual CSV columns
3. **Implement one feature at a time** (start with loading data)
4. **Commit to GitHub after each feature**
5. **Test constantly** as you build

This gives you a **complete framework** to build upon. Every piece of code I've provided is **generic and educational** - you MUST customize it for your specific data and requirements.
